initialized by 
tsc --init
and it generated tsconfig.json file

npm init -y
to generate package.json and -y is used to skip answering questions while it is being initialized

tsc -w
(observes the changes and based on tsconfig generated file in the specified directory)

npm i lite-server
and into package.json, change the start mode to take a load from lite-server
or another way could be to use the Live Share extension or any other stuff just to run the server

use npm start in case of lite-server is configured
